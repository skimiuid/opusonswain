                        <p>Edgar joined Opus on Swain just six months ago, bringing a whirlwind of energy to the studio. Like many 8-year-olds, his initial challenge was channeling his enthusiasm into focused finger work.</p>
                        <p>He is currently working on <em>Adventures in Keyland</em> and loves anything that sounds "fast and loud." His goal for this year is to learn the theme song from Star Wars.</p>

                        <p>Victor is one of our most advanced students, currently preparing for rigorous college auditions. He has a natural gravity at the piano, producing a deep, resonant tone that belies his age.</p>
                        <p>Currently, Victor is tackling Rachmaninoff's <em>Prelude in G Minor</em>. Outside of piano, Victor composes his own electronic music, which gives him a unique perspective on classical harmony.</p>

                        <p>Lily played piano as a child but stopped during college. Now a marketing executive, she returned to the piano looking for a way to disconnect from screens. She calls her Wednesday evening lessons her "therapy hour."</p>
                        <p>She has a special affinity for the Romantic era. We are currently working on Chopin's Nocturnes, focusing on rubato and "bel canto" singing tone.</p>

                        <p>Sarah has an incredibly sensitive ear. While many students love fast and flashy pieces, Sarah is drawn to color and atmosphere. She was the one who asked to learn Debussy.</p>
                        <p>Her current focus is on pedal technique—learning that the pedal isn't just an on/off switch, but a tool for mixing colors. She is preparing <em>The Girl with the Flaxen Hair</em> for the Spring recital.</p>

                        <p>Mateo is a rare talent. Discovering he had perfect pitch at age 6, he can hear a song on the radio and play it back almost instantly. The challenge is getting him to read the notes!</p>
                        <p>We use a hybrid curriculum for Mateo. Half the lesson is standard classical repertoire to build discipline, and the other half is Jazz improvisation, where he learns to read lead sheets.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Thorne approaches piano with the mind of an academic. A retired history professor, he isn't satisfied with just playing the notes; he wants to know why Bach wrote them that way.</p>
                        <p>He admits that his fingers aren't as fast as they used to be, but his understanding of musical structure is profound. He is currently working through the <em>Well-Tempered Clavier</em>.</p>

                        <p>Chloe is a powerhouse. Driven and disciplined, she enters local and state competitions regularly. However, last year she struggled with severe stage fright. We have shifted our focus from "perfection" to "communication."</p>
                        <p>She recently performed Liszt's <em>Liebestraum</em> with shaking hands but a singing heart, a massive breakthrough for her confidence.</p>

                        <p>Jackson breaks the stereotype that you can't be an athlete and a musician. As a competitive soccer player, his schedule is packed, but he treats piano practice with the same dedication as his drills.</p>
                        <p>We focus on "efficient practice" techniques for Jackson—how to get the most out of 20 minutes a day. He loves energetic, rhythmic pieces by Kabalevsky and Bartók.</p>

                        <p>She is currently exploring the lighter side of classical music—Mozart Sonatas and Satie's Gymnopédies. Anya brings a wonderful curiosity to her lessons, often drawing parallels between biology patterns and music theory.</p>
