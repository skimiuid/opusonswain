                        <p>Miles Swaminathan is a pianist and composer at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he studies under Jean-Louis Haguenauer. A recipient of the 2024 Florence Price Piano Concerto Award and the Artist Presentation Society Piano Prize, he has also been recognized as a laureate of the Music International Grand Prix for Original Composition. In 2025, his solo work A Night at the Observatory won First Prize in the Tonal Category at the 18th Fidelio International Piano Competition. Equally devoted to performance and creation, Swaminathan continues to shape a distinctive artistic voice that bridges virtuosity, lyricism, and imagination.</p>
                        <p>Miles's teaching philosophy is holistic. He encourages students to look beyond the keyboard—integrating music theory, history, and analysis into every lesson. He is particularly passionate about helping students understand the "why" behind the music, fostering independent artistic voices.</p>
