                    <li><strong>24-Hour Notice Rule:</strong> Cancellations made with less than 24 hours' notice will be charged the full lesson fee. No make-up credits will be issued for late cancellations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make-up Lessons:</strong> We offer 2 "flex credits" per semester for excused absences (illness/emergency) given with proper notice. These can be used to book a make-up slot or roll over to the next month.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tardiness:</strong> If you are late, the lesson will still end at the scheduled time. We cannot extend lessons into the next student's time slot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teacher Absence:</strong> If the teacher must cancel due to professional performance engagements or illness, a full refund or a mutually agreed make-up time will be provided.</li>

                    <li><strong>Home Instrument:</strong> An acoustic piano (tuned annually) is ideal. If digital, it <strong>must</strong> have 88 fully weighted keys (hammer action) and a sustain pedal. Unweighted keyboards are not acceptable after the first 2 months of study.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice Expectations:</strong> Progress happens at home, not just in the lesson.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beginners: 15-20 mins, 5 days/week.</li>

                    <li><strong>Discontinuing Lessons:</strong> We require a <strong>30-day written notice</strong> (email is acceptable) to terminate lessons. This allows us to wrap up current repertoire and fill the vacancy from our waitlist.</li>
